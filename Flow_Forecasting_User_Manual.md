## Getting Started

### Basic Workflow

1. **Choose Analysis Mode**: Select Forecast, Probability, or Target
2. **Select Method**: Choose Throughput or Cycle Time analysis
3. **Input Data**: Enter project parameters and historical data
4. **Configure Simulation**: Set trials, confidence levels, and advanced options
5. **Run Forecast**: Execute Monte Carlo simulation
6. **Analyze Results**: Review confidence intervals and visualizations
7. **Save Scenarios**: Store results for comparison
8. **Export Reports**: Generate PDF, CSV, or image outputs

### Quick Start Tips

- **New Users**: Start with Throughput Analysis if you know team velocity
- **Minimum Data**: Backlog size + throughput metrics OR cycle time percentiles
- **Recommended Trials**: 10,000 simulations for balance of accuracy and speed
- **Best Practice**: Use 80% confidence for stakeholder commitments

## Analysis Modes

### 1. Standard Forecast

**Purpose**: Predict when your project will complete based on current parameters

**When to Use**:
- Need completion date ranges with confidence intervals
- Have no fixed deadline constraints
- Want comprehensive statistical analysis
- Planning resource allocation

**What You Get**:
- Confidence intervals (50%, 80%, 95%)
- Statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Distribution histogram
- Cumulative probability S-curve
- Export-ready reports

**Example Use Case**: "Our team needs to complete 100 story points. When will we likely finish?"

### 2. Probability Analysis

**Purpose**: Calculate the likelihood of meeting a specific target date

**When to Use**:
- Have a fixed deadline or target date
- Need to assess risk of missing the deadline
- Want to communicate success probability to stakeholders
- Making go/no-go decisions based on likelihood

**How It Works**:
1. Runs standard forecast simulation
2. Calculates days between today and target date
3. Counts simulation outcomes completing within timeframe
4. Converts to percentage probability of success

**Result Interpretation**:
- **Low (<50%)**: High risk - consider scope reduction or deadline extension
- **Medium (50-80%)**: Moderate risk - monitor closely with contingency plans
- **High (>80%)**: Low risk - good confidence in meeting deadline

**Example Use Case**: "We must complete by December 15th. What's our probability of success?"

### 3. Target Analysis

**Purpose**: Determine optimal start dates to meet a specified deadline

**When to Use**:
- Have fixed deadline but flexible start date
- Need to determine optimal project timing
- Want to see how early start affects success probability
- Presenting start date recommendations to stakeholders

**How It Works**:
1. Uses baseline forecast to understand completion times
2. Calculates time buffers for different confidence levels
3. Works backwards from target date
4. Shows probability curve across different start dates

**Key Visualizations**:
- **Success Probability by Start Date Chart**: Shows how chances improve with earlier starts
- **Start Date Recommendations**: Conservative (95%), Balanced (80%), Aggressive (50%)

**Example Use Case**: "We must deliver by March 1st. When should we start for 80% confidence?"

## Forecasting Methods

### Throughput Analysis

**Best For**:
- Teams working in regular sprints/iterations
- Consistent team velocity measurements
- Multiple items completed per time period
- Forecasting based on team productivity

**Required Data**:
- Backlog size (total items to complete)
- Average throughput (items per week/sprint)
- Start date

**Optional Data**:
- Throughput variability (Coefficient of Variation)
- Historical throughput data for automatic calculations
- Weekly capacity limits

**How It Works**:
1. Simulates team throughput using log-normal distribution
2. Models realistic variability in team performance
3. Applies capacity constraints and minimum progress rules
4. Accumulates daily progress until backlog completion
5. Applies risk factors if configured

**Mathematical Model**:
- Uses log-normal distribution for realistic throughput modeling
- Bootstrap sampling from historical data when available
- Coefficient of Variation typically 0.2-0.4 for most teams

### Cycle Time Analysis

**Best For**:
- Individual item completion time data available
- Variable item sizes or complexity
- Workflow optimization focus
- Service-oriented or flow-based teams

**Required Data**:
- Backlog size (total items to complete)
- P50 Cycle Time (median completion time in days)
- P80 Cycle Time (80th percentile)
- P95 Cycle Time (95th percentile)
- Start date

**Processing Modes**:

1. **Worker Scheduling** (Default):
   - Assigns items to earliest available team member
   - Models parallel work streams
   - Realistic for most development teams

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Processes items in batches
   - Waits for slowest item in each batch
   - Suitable for release-based workflows

**How It Works**:
1. Derives log-normal parameters from percentile data
2. Simulates individual item completion times
3. Models team capacity constraints (WIP limits)
4. Schedules items based on processing mode
5. Applies risk factors and dependencies

## Data Requirements

### Data Quality Guidelines

**Minimum Requirements**:
- At least 30 historical data points for reliable statistics
- Data representing similar work types and team composition
- Consistent time units (days, weeks) across measurements
- Only completed items, not work in progress

**Best Practices**:
- Exclude clear outliers or non-representative periods
- Account for team composition changes
- Consider seasonal variations (holidays, vacations)
- Use data from after major process improvements

### Common Data Issues

1. **Inconsistent Item Sizing**: Use story points or T-shirt sizes consistently
2. **Mixed Work Types**: Separate features, bugs, and technical debt
3. **Team Changes**: Account for significant composition changes
4. **Seasonal Variations**: Consider holidays and vacation periods
5. **Process Changes**: Use data from after improvements

### Data Collection Tips

- **Throughput Data**: Count items completed per sprint/week
- **Cycle Time Data**: Measure from start to completion of individual items
- **Historical Data**: Gather at least 3 months of consistent measurements
- **Validation**: Ensure data represents current team and process state

- Impact in days if risk occurs
- Multiple risks can be defined

**Example Risks**:
- Third-party integration delays (30% chance, 5 days impact)
- Key team member vacation (20% chance, 3 days impact)
- Requirement changes (15% chance, 7 days impact)

### Dependency Modeling

**Purpose**: Account for external dependencies using PERT distribution

**Parameters**:
- Optimistic duration (best case)
- Most likely duration (expected case)
- Pessimistic duration (worst case)

**Use Cases**:
- External API availability
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Third-party deliverables
- Regulatory approvals

### Team Capacity Modeling

**Features**:
- Learning curve effects for new team members
- Potential burnout modeling for extended periods
- Capacity adjustments over time
- Seasonal availability variations

### Simulation Configuration

**Trial Settings**:

- Confidence levels (customizable percentiles)
- Random seed for reproducible results
- Performance vs. accuracy trade-offs

## Understanding Results

### Statistical Measures

**Mean**: Average completion date across all simulations
- Useful for resource planning
- Can be skewed by outliers

**Median**: Middle value when results are sorted
- Often more realistic than mean
- Less affected by extreme outliers

**Standard Deviation**: Measure of uncertainty/variability
- Higher values indicate more uncertainty
- Helps assess project risk level

**Skewness**: Asymmetry in the distribution
- Positive skew indicates delay risk
- Negative skew suggests early completion potential

### Confidence Intervals

**50% Confidence**: Half of simulations completed by this date
- Use for internal planning
- Realistic middle estimate

**80% Confidence**: More realistic target with buffer
- Recommended for stakeholder commitments
- Good balance of confidence and efficiency

**95% Confidence**: Conservative estimate with significant buffer
- Use for critical deadlines with high penalty
- Maximum safety margin

### Chart Interpretation

**Histogram Chart**:
- **Peak**: Most likely completion timeframe
- **Width**: Uncertainty level (wider = more uncertain)
- **Skew**: Risk direction (right skew = delay risk)
- **Reference Lines**: Confidence interval boundaries

**S-Curve Chart**:
- **X-axis**: Completion dates
- **Y-axis**: Cumulative probability of completion
- **Steep Sections**: High probability periods
- **Flat Sections**: Low probability periods
