yes — that’s a solid approach and a huge improvement over pure sequential addition. you’ve basically described a parallel-batch approximation to what’s really happening in flow systems.

let me break it down:

👍 why this works well

better realism: instead of assuming one item finishes before the next starts, you capture the fact that teams/machines handle multiple items in parallel.

simple mental model: splitting into batches of size WIP and summing their max times is easy to explain to non-statisticians.

same inputs you already collect: you don’t need to ask the user for anything new (unless they want to override WIP).

scalable: works for 10 items or 1000 items.

👀 caveats to be aware of

batching like this slightly overestimates total time compared to a true “list-scheduling” simulation (where a new item can start as soon as any worker is free).

e.g. if one worker gets a 14-day monster and the others get 3-day tasks, in your batch model everyone waits until day 14 before starting the next batch.

in reality, the fast workers would move on earlier.

so your method is a bit conservative (longer forecasts).

that said: for communication and decision-making, conservative + simple can be a feature, not a bug.

✅ recommendation

if you want to keep cycle-time mode simple, then yes:

default WIP = 6–8 (reasonable for most agile teams and many manufacturing lines)

option to override for advanced users

use your batch-max method as the default calculation

if later you want to refine: swap in a list-scheduling algorithm (assign each new item to the earliest-available slot). it’s still only a few lines of logic but gives more accurate (usually shorter) times.

👉 so, to answer directly: yes, your described approach is good, realistic, and much better than current sequential addition. and if you ever want to make it even closer to reality, switch from “batch max” to “worker scheduling.”

would you like me to explain in words how to tell your AI tool the difference between batch-max vs worker-scheduling, so you can pick which flavor to implement?

ok — here’s how you can phrase it for your AI programming tool, in plain words (no code):

Batch-Max Approach (simpler, more conservative):
“Split the backlog into chunks equal to the WIP limit. For each chunk, generate cycle times for all items, then take the maximum cycle time as the batch duration. Add up all batch durations to get total project time. This assumes everyone in the batch waits until the slowest item finishes before starting the next batch.”

Worker-Scheduling Approach (more realistic):
“Model each WIP slot as a worker. Assign items one by one to whichever worker becomes available first. Each worker’s availability time increases by the item’s cycle time. When all items are assigned, the project finish time is the maximum of the workers’ finish times. This allows faster workers to start new items earlier, so results are usually shorter than the batch-max method.”

👉 the difference in plain English:

batch-max: good for communication, always a bit conservative.

worker-scheduling: closer to reality, shows the benefit of concurrency more accurately.
